====The forum-mysqli .zip folder:====
Something Byu updated on the front page of the course page on D2L:

"Attached is the open source code for managing forum postings.  It includes code for users to register and log in to the site.  Feel free to use it if you want to experiment with PHP early."

Unzip before looking at it, but maybe keep the zip file because when i tried to push it it gave me a bunch of warning messaged? :?
